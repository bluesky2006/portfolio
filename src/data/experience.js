      "I completed an intensive full-time bootcamp with Northcoders, focused on full-stack JavaScript development. The course emphasised Agile methodologies, pair programming, and TDD, with a strong focus on collaboration and clean code. I built scalable web and mobile apps using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, React Native, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs, following the MVC architecture. I also worked with Git, GitHub, Vite, Render, Supabase, Netlify, Expo, and the Gemini API, with testing handled via Jest and Supertest.",

      "As Production Lead at Pip Decks, I helped bridge print and digital design. I developed a robust XML workflow for transferring print content into the app and rebuilt the master InDesign template for consistency across products. I also applied artwork to packaging nets, contributed to product concepts like notebooks and workbooks, and created brand-consistent designs for Miro board products. I proofread content, refined the house style guide, and upheld best design practices to improve quality across assets.",
