      "I completed an intensive full-time bootcamp with Northcoders, focused on full-stack JavaScript development. The course emphasized Agile methodologies, pair programming, and test-driven development, with a strong focus on collaboration, clean code, and practical debugging skills. I built scalable web and mobile applications using core technologies such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React, React Native, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and REST APIs, following the MVC architecture. Testing was carried out using Jest and Supertest. I also worked with a range of tools and platforms including Git, GitHub, Vite, Render, Supabase, Netlify, Expo, and the Gemini API, gaining experience in both frontend and backend development workflows.",

      "As Production Lead at Pip Decks, I played a key role in bridging print and digital design. I developed a robust XML workflow to streamline the transfer of print content into the company’s app, improving efficiency and accuracy. I rebuilt the master InDesign template for their card products, ensuring consistency and ease of use across new releases. My responsibilities also included applying artwork to packaging nets, helping to concept new print products like notebooks and workbooks, and creating brand-consistent designs for Miro board products. I provided feedback that directly influenced updates to core content, proofread materials, updated the house style guide, and upheld best design practices to enhance the quality and consistency of all digital assets.",
